# Satarangi Aasmaan - Expense Management (Odoo x Amalthea Hackathon)

## üö© Problem Statement

Companies often struggle with manual expense reimbursement processes that are time-consuming, error-prone, and lack transparency. There is no simple way to:
*   Define approval flows based on thresholds.
*   Manage multi-level approvals.
*   Support flexible and conditional approval rules.

Our solution, Satarangi Aasmaan, addresses these pain points with a modern, full-stack application.
